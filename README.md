# gdevsim 0.0.1

> :warning: **Warning**: This project is in early development stages and may be subject to significant changes.

A simplified interface (enabled by gdsfactory) and collection of models to the open-source TCAD simulator DEVSIM.

Features:
* Easily define simulations from gdsfactory primitives (Components, LayerStacks, Ports)
* Seamlessly simulate devices from existing gdsfactory PDKs
* Repository of documented semiconductor models
* Adaptive mesh refinement
* Automatic file management; manipulate all inputs and outputs from Python
* Hassle-free installation: `pip install gdevsim`
* Compatible with [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) for seamless distributed computing (local/cluster/cloud), lazy parallelism, and optimization

The aim is to sacrifice some flexibility for simpler automation. To setup more fine-grained simulations, DEVSIM can be used directly.

## Usage

See the documentation for more information on the API or for examples.

The CAD backend is gdsfactory. The meshing backend is meshwell, which wraps gmsh. The solver backend is DEVSIM.

## Installation

For users:

`pip install gdevsim`

For contributors:

`pip install gdevsim[dev]`
